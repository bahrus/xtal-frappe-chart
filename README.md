# \<xtal-frappe-chart\>

Web component wrapper around the cool [Frappe chart](https://frappe.io/charts) library.

Things I like about this chart library:

1)  It is quite small (17kb), yet, unlike chartist, it has nice interactive features.
2)  It supports ES6 Modules (and iffe).
3)  The charts look nice.

## Install the Polymer-CLI

First, make sure you have the [Polymer CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polymer-cli) and npm (packaged with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)) installed. Run `npm install` to install your element's dependencies, then run `polymer serve` to serve your element locally.

## Viewing Your Element

```
$ polymer serve
```

## Running Tests

```
$ polymer test
```

Your application is already set up to be tested via [web-component-tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester). Run `polymer test` to run your application's test suite locally.
